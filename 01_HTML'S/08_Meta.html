  <p>Meta tags are pieces of code within an HTML document that provide information about the webpage. They aren't
    displayed on the page itself but are used by search engines and other web tools to understand the content and
    context of the page. Meta tags are essential for SEO, helping search engines determine how to rank a webpage in
    search results. </p>

  <pre>
ðŸŸ  Meta tags are a way to provide additional metadata about a webpage. 

ðŸŸ  They are not visible to users, but are used by search engines and other web tools. 

ðŸŸ  They include information like the page title, description, keywords, author, and other details.
